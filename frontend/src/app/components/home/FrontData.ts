    text: `  NetFarms takes farm management to the next level with a
    variety of benefits to help the modern farmer take the
    guesswork out of farming. With a sophisticated dashboard you
    can optimise your farm today.Agriculture is the world’s
    largest industry. It employs more than one billion people
    and generates tons of food annually. When agricultural
    operations are sustainably managed, they can preserve and
    restore critical habitats, help protect watersheds, and
    improve soil health and water quality. But unsustainable
    practices have serious impacts on people and the
    environment. The need for sustainable resource management is
    increasingly urgent. Demand for agricultural commodities is
    rising rapidly as the world’s population grows.
    Agriculture’s deep connections to the world economy, human
    societies and biodiversity make it one of the most important
    frontiers for conservation around the globe. While
    agricultural operations provide unique opportunities to
    conserve biodiversity, they also can threaten wild species
    and spaces. From habitat loss to pollution, agriculture
    contributes to many of the environmental challenges that we
    all need to address.

    text: ` Technological innovations have greatly shaped agriculture throughout time. From the creation of the plow to the global positioning system (GPS) driven precision farming equipment, humans have developed new ways to make farming more efficient and grow more food. We are constantly working to find new ways to irrigate crops or breed more disease resistant varieties. These iterations are key to feeding the ever-expanding global population with the decreasing freshwater supply.

    Applications of agritech are far-ranging and encompass several different types of agricultural and technological innovations. However, the aim of all these agricultural technology also referred to as agritech, is the same – an attempt to grow more food in less space and/or with fewer inputs. Agritech also saves farmers time and money, by automating tasks and replacing much of the labor needed on a farming operation – which usually constitutes the highest cost input to a farming system.
